# odin-recipes

Hello to you who's reading this! This project is a website that contains my favorite and easy-to-cook dinner recipes.

The creation of this project includes the demonstration of all the HTML knowledge I have gained so far in this journey. So that will include: working with text, lists, links and images and how to write good commit messages!

This website now also includes basic CSS to add a little bit of beauty to it!

I hope you enjoy this simple website!
